### The Legitimate State Theory

In her 2011 work, *Nations, States and Territories*[^1a], Dr [Anna Stilz](https://scholar.princeton.edu/astilz/home) begins by raising the question of the formation of the US. It is a country formed over time, finally ending in its current geographic territory. States such as Florida, Hawaii, Texas as well as territories like the Philippines and Puerto Rico were slowly won or bought from their previous owners. Given such a colourful history, Dr Stilz asks if all these territories were legitimate. (NonCentrist would request our readers to find out more about the history of states like Hawaii as well as other states ceded as colonies of other European powers, just to put the problems today into perspective.)

Clearly, it is a question that many other countries face today. India, Pakistan and Kashmir; China and Hong Kong; Russia, Ukraine and the Crimea; Israel and the Palestine; China and its 'nine-dash line' in the South China Sea. All these problems revolve around who actually has a right over a certain territory. And the history of the US only makes it clear that such annexations (and resulting disputes) are part of human civilisation.
