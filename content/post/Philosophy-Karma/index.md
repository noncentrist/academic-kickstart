## Understanding the Buddhist Theory of Karma

### The Buddhist Doctrine of karmic fruition (i.e. what most people know)

In popular teaching/pop culture: the law of karma is a moral dimension to our universe just like the law of gravity is a physical dimension. According to the law of karma, a person who acts a certain way must later experience consequences depending on the nature of the action. "Geshe Ngawang Dhargyey, a modern Tibetan author, thus explains the law of karma as **<u>a special case of the general law of cause and effect.</u>**". Every mood that a living being may have is the natural fruition of actions performed in the past, and *no emotional state arises by chance or luck.*

This 'popular version' of the law of karma seems, on the surface at least, well-grounded in our ordinary experiences. Wrongdoing generally leads to a feeling of guilt and remorse. However, the more precise and rigorous presentations of Buddhist theory ('*abhidharma*') is more constrained and formal. 

### *Abhidharma* - formalised Buddhist karma

The teachings and words of the Buddha were generally delivered to ordinary people in the local vernacular (aka. simpler, loose linguistic and conceptual conventions), so it could be easily understood and adopted in our routine lives. However, the *abhidharma* exists to convey the teachings of the Buddha in a more exact and formal way, free from conceptual shortcuts. 

But first, what is the true reason/concept behind some phenomena we experience? According to [Vasubandhu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vasubandhu/) (an Indian *abhidharma* specialist), the way we judge something to be ultimately real, instead of some convenient social fiction, is *simplicity* or *irreducibility*. A pot is merely a configuration of atoms that serves the need of people for storage. Once these needs do not exist, the word "pot" falls into disuse (the pot is not a pot anymore). However, the atoms continue existing (and are therefore real), independent of societal conventions. Applying this to philosophical concepts, we arrive at something much like Occam's Razor. 

> If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments where one suffices.
>
> &mdash; St. Thomas Aquinas, [quote](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/). Signifies the role of *simplicity* in philosophy (that is today popularly known through Occam's Razor)

By this method, humans are, broadly, 2 sets of components: a physical body and a collection of four mental properties[^1]. Since a person herself is not *an ultimate reality* like an atom, **who is actually acting/doing the *karma?*** Clearly, it must be one of the aforementioned mental properties. By consequence (haha see what I did there?) **who/what experiences the effects of that act**? Then, a logical question becomes "**why must the originator of karma be the eventual experiencer of the results?**". And finally, if an effect doesn't happen immediately after an act, then **where is the result stored?**

An example given in Buddhist literature is of a murderer being liable to be reborn as a predatory animal like a jackal. But where is the 'seed' of the murderous act stored until the murderer dies and a jackal is born? Do we suppose that the atoms from the human somehow bear an imprint of the human's actions, only to reformulate later into a jackal's body? If this happens, then how does the collection of mental properties follow into that new body?

### Vasubandhu's explanation of karma & causality

Vasubandhu, through a series of 3 principles (which are not explained well), concludes that there is no enduring identity for any composite thing. For example, a person has no identity, no enduring self. This is harmonious with the general Buddhist tenet of [momentariness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abhidharma/#TimImpMom). This theory posits that every composite thing decomposes in each moment, but some composite properties *cause* the creation of a similar composite thing in the next moment. Actions obey the same law. The criteria for which properties affect the next moment are not discussed for reasons of brevity in the lecture.

Now we get to the meat of the argument. Vasubandhu recognises 2 types of causes relevant to karma. The first is 'similar cause', which gives rise to an effect similar to itself. These causes can be 'profitable', 'unprofitable', or 'indeterminate'. A profitable similar cause will lead to a desired result and thus causes temporary contentment, and vice versa. 'Profitability' extends to things like *premeditated* bodily and verbal actions, as well as thoughts and accompanying acts of awareness. All other things are undefined in terms of 'profitability'. *Theditor's note: what things are undefined? A shiver is not premeditated, but it makes one feel better and warm.*

The second type of cause is the 'fruition cause'. It is the cause that gives rise to the final result of a causal sequence started by an action in the past. Being the final fruition, it does not create further profitable or unprofitable things, but the fruition itself must have been caused by such a thing. One unexplained point is that *unprofitable actions are said to always have a corresponding fruition*, but not all profitable actions do. Only profitable actions/karma accompanied by a false belief in the enduring self produce consequences. Vasubandhu mentions that such people, who lack wisdom and act out of desire for future rewards, perform meritorious action. Meritorious action is profitable, and it always results in temporary happiness. However, not all profitable action is meritorious.

Based on these 2 types of causes, we see how an action now can have an effect later: the action causes 'similar causes' which go on for as many moments as required, and then it has a final effect when it causes the 'fruition cause'. To NonCentrist, an apt analogy would be a series of contraptions, triggered by a simple button. The button starts a ball rolling down, which hits and topples a broom and the chain continues until the very end when the trigger of a gun (probably aimed at you) is pulled, causing you to experience a sensation. But a question that arises in the theory (and this analogy) is *what keeps the causal chain associated with the same actor?*

The rest of the paper was too difficult for us to understand, so we will revisit it at another time.
