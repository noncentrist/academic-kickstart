### Introduction 

In this topic, we try to understand border clashes as well as annexation disputes that have occurred throughout contemporary human history. Some guiding questions for us as writers were:

- **<u>Geopolitics</u>**: Why do some regions (usually developing) face constant border disputes whereas other do not?
- **<u>Politics</u>**: How have countries justified annexation of a territory in the past?
- **<u>Philosophy</u>**: Who truly has a right over a territory?

### Episodes

In this endeavour, we produce the following episodes. 

- [Ep-1]({{< ref "01-01-philosophy-of-territory" >}}): The philosophical background of territorial expansion/annexation.

The list will be updated with further episodes. 

Stay woke, keep your eyes unclosed.
