This topic in ***The NonCentrist*** focuses on the territorial dispute surrounding Kashmir (a shorthand term for the state of Jammu & Kashmir). We try to  understand what brought us to today, and how different perspectives formed around this polarising issue.

Some of the questions readers might think about are:

- How do we define ‘<u>right to a territory</u>’? Is it just the strong ruling over the weak?
- Why do people protest (on both sides of the issue)? What do protests hope to achieve? 
- Why is national sovereignty of utmost importance? Should it be?
- How have internal politics and governments affected the course of Kashmiri history?
- What is the ‘right’ way to proceed on a disputed territory:  self-determination, across religious lines or across military prowess? 
- Why do countries/powers sometimes prefer to allow limited independence to their states?

All of these questions are very important. Through the upcoming  series on Kashmiri history, independence and annexation, we delve deeper into giving different solutions to the questions posed above.
