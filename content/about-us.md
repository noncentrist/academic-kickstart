## Ever felt like this world is going to shit?

Us too. But instead of giving up on human beings, we decided to experiment with a new way of learning. Our articles focus on analysing every issue from the perspective of each side, and leaving the verdict up to the reader. 

Objective right or wrong is tricky to nail down. Thus, our core argument is that depending on the philosophy we subscribe to (consciously or not), we define it for ourselves. 

So learn with us about philosophy and religion, and how it manifests in our daily lives.

> *Both conservatives and liberals agree among themselves… in uncannily identical language, that their opponents lack any self-awareness or empathy, the ability to see the other side of an argument or to laugh at themselves. Which would seem to suggest that they’re both correct.*
