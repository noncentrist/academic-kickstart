The Editor is an anonymous representation of all writers for the NonCentrist. They are selected for their relative inability to judge right or wrong easily even after they have thoroughly examined a specific issue. 

The Editor requests all readers to be willing to read about a perspective that they do not emotionally agree with, and to think in a *NonCentrist* way.
